# Program Overview

This advanced enablement moves from “knowing Delta/Medallion” to **operating production-grade pipelines**: real-time ingestion, incremental CDC, late data, efficient Spark transforms, and operational guardrails.

## Learning Outcomes
- Build **incremental & idempotent** pipelines (batch + streaming) with CDC and replay
- Handle **late/out-of-order** events (watermarks, stateful dedup)
- Tune Spark: joins, skew handling, AQE, narrow vs wide transforms
- Optimize Delta: compaction/OPTIMIZE, CLUSTER BY / Z-ORDER, statistics
- Add guardrails: **DQ checks, alerts, and Jobs** orchestration

## What’s Included
- Runnable labs for each half-day (see `labs-advanced/*`)
- Synthetic data generators (`datasets/`)
- Secrets placeholders (no credentials in code)
- Light CI smoke checks for repo health
